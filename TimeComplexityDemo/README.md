# Time Complexity Demo

# Purpose

This is a macOS Command Line Tool application that shows some examples of algorithms and their time complexity, using the 'Big O' notation.

# Big O notation - time complexities types

## Constant

When the run time of an algorithm stays the same regardless of the algorithm's input size. See `constant` methos from [main.swift](TimeComplexityDemo/main.swift) for more details.

## Linear

When the run time of an algorithm increases alongside the increase of the algorithm's input. See `linear` method from [main.swift](TimeComplexityDemo/main.swift) for more details.

## Logarithmic

When the run time of an algorithm increases in a logarithmic way. Either log using base 2 or base 10. See `logarithmic` method from [main.swift](TimeComplexityDemo/main.swift) for more details.

## Quadratic

When the run time of an algorithm increases in a 'squared' way, ie n^2. Example: a loop inside a loop. See `quadratic` method from [main.swift](TimeComplexityDemo/main.swift) for more details.

## Exponential

When the run time of an algorithm increases exponentially compared to the algorithm's input. See `exponential` method from [main.swift](TimeComplexityDemo/main.swift) for more details.

# Simulator class

The Simulator [class](TimeComplexityDemo/main.swift) contains code that calculates how many seconds it takes for an algorithm to run and also prints out the time when the algorithm started to run and end.
