## Continuous Learning and Growth

As a developer, I believe that learning never stops. I'm constantly exploring new technologies, keeping up with the latest trends in iOS development, and improving my current skills. In addition to working on these projects, I regularly:

- Follow WWDC videos to stay up-to-date on new iOS features.
- Explore Swift, SwiftUI, Async Await, and other modern frameworks as part of my learning journey.
