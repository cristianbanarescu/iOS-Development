# iOS Development by Cristian Bănărescu

Welcome to my iOS development portfolio! I am an enthusiastic iOS developer with a strong passion for learning and building creative mobile solutions. My repository is a collection of various iOS projects that showcase my skills in Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and modern iOS development practices. Whether I'm working on simple utilities or more complex apps, my goal is to continuously grow as a developer, embrace new challenges, and deliver exceptional user experiences.

I am always eager to collaborate, receive feedback, and contribute to exciting projects, so feel free to explore my work and reach out!

- **Other**: Auto Layout, Storyboards, Programmatic UI, Dark Mode support, Localization

## Topics & Demo projects

These are a collection of demo projects that showcase my skills and experience in iOS development. Each project is designed to demonstrate a specific concept or technology, from core Swift fundamentals to more advanced frameworks and APIs. These demos highlight my hands-on approach to learning and applying new techniques in real-world scenarios:

- For `Accessibility` (Voice Over and Dynamic Type) please check out [AccessibilityDemo](./AccessibilityDemo/)
- For general `Swift concepts` please check out [SwiftDemo](./SwiftDemo/)
- For `Networking` (URLSession and Alamofire) please check out [NetworkingDemo](./NetworkingDemo/)
- For `Cocoapods` and `Lottie-ios` usage please check out [CocoaPodsDemo](./CocoaPodsDemo/)
- For `ARC(Automatic reference counting)` in Swift, please check out [ARCDemo](./ARCDemo/)
- For more details on iOS memory management, check [this page](./memory-management.md)
- For `WKWebView` or `SFSafariViewController` please check out [WebContentDemo](./WebContentDemo/)
- For `UITableView` please check out [TableViewUIKitDemo](./TableViewUIKitDemo/)
- For `SwiftUI` related projects and examples, please see [SwiftUI folder](./SwiftUI)
- For `Data structures and algorithms` please see [Data structures and algorithms](./Data%20structures%20&%20Algorithms/)
- For cross-platform projects&demos, please see the Flutter [folder](./Flutter)
- See the [Git & Github page](git.md) for useful information on how to use Git & Github for an iOS developer and in general.
- See the [Concurrency & Multithreading page](./Concurrency/Concurrency.md) contains useful information about: multithreading, GCD, Swift Concurrency, serial vs concurrent queues, sync vs async, etc.
- See the [AI page](AI.md) for more details regarding AI, prompting and usages in iOS development.

## Continuous Learning and Growth

As a developer, I believe that learning never stops. I'm constantly exploring new technologies, keeping up with the latest trends in iOS development, and improving my current skills. In addition to working on these projects, I regularly:

- Follow WWDC videos to stay up-to-date on new iOS features.
- Explore Swift, SwiftUI, Async Await, and other modern frameworks as part of my learning journey.
- Go through my list of newsletters to stay up to date with technology

## Let's Collaborate!

I'm always open to feedback and collaboration. If you're working on an exciting iOS project or have feedback on any of my work, don't hesitate to reach out! Feel free to fork this repository, open issues, or submit pull requests.
