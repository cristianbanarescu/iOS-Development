#  Networking Demo

## Purpose

- This project showcases how to perform network requests using URLSession and Alamofire
- It also showcases the usage of the Codable protocol so that objects can be both decoded/coded from/to network responses

## Data Sources

- This project uses the JSON Placeholder `posts` API from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ in order to perform network requests
- This project uses a table view built using SwiftUI in order to display data fetched from the API
