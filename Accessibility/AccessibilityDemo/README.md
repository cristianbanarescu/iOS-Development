#  Accessibility Demo

## Purpose 

- This project showcases the usage of Voice Over and Dynamic Type.
- It also contains a basic UI test in order to demonstrate the usage of accessibility identifiers and labels.

## Data Sources

- This project fetches and displays data gathered from https://www.openbrewerydb.org/. 
- In order to not block the Main Thread of the app, the Global dispatch queue is used to fetch data from OpenBreweryDB in a concurrent way.
