# CocoaPods Demo 

## Purpose 

- This project is an iOS application created using SwiftUI.
- It includes a basic animation created using Lottie iOS (https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios), integrated with the help of CocoaPods.

## Implementation 

- Lottie iOS doesn't directly support SwiftUI so the animation had to be created by conforming to the `UIViewRepresentable` protocol.

## Data Sources

- In order to add the Lottie animation, this project uses an already created JSON animation from https://lottiefiles.com/9501-icons-package-setting.
