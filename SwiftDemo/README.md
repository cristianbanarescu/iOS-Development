This file contains ideas, notes and other useful info related to the Swift language itself.
It may also contain details about Swift concepts and Demos.

- Swift uses Unicode-correct Strings with UTF-8 encoding > good for internationalization
- Inferred types
- Memory - reference counting 
- Generics
- Protocol extensions
- First class functions > Use functions and methods inside other functions or methods; pass functions as arguments, save them in properties; pass initializers as arguments
- Functional programming patterns - map, filter
- Swift uses value types for commonly used types, like Arrays or Dictionaries
- Optionals - binding, chaining, nil coalescing 
- LLVM Compiler 
- Source and binary compatibility 
- Swift for Server 
- Swift Package Manager - build, run, test and package Swift libraries and executables; easy to distribute the code 
- Array vs Set vs Dictionary 
- Tuples - groups of values 
- Swift is type-safe: if you need an Int, you can't pass a String by mistake; Swift does not let you pass an Optional String when you actually need a String (ie non-optional String)
