# AI Tools for Developers

## Overview

This page covers AI concepts, particularly generative AI (ChatGPT), and offers insights for developers on integrating these tools into their workflows to enhance productivity and innovation.

For a detailed deep dive into different AI tools, concepts, demos, please check out the Generative AI Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-ai-guide/)

## Applications of AI in Development

AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can assist developers by:
- generating boilerplate code
- optimizing algorithms
- debugging errors efficiently
- answering technical questions 
- generating documentation

## Best practices/resources/tips to improve prompts and outputs

- Specify exactly what you need, including constraints or desired formats.
- Add sample inputs and outputs for clarity.
- Refine prompts based on ChatGPT's responses to improve results.
- **Use Temperature and Max Tokens**: Adjust these parameters in the API to control the randomness and length of responses.
